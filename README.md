# FastAPI + Celery
I built this simple project to test fastAPI with celery to handle larger processing jobs.

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Celery** is a simple, highly-scalable distributed system that provides a flexible mechanism to implement task queues in real-time.
Celery: https://github.com/celery/celery

# Flower for visualization
Flower is an open-source web application for monitoring and managing Celery clusters. It provides real-time information about the status of Celery workers and tasks.
